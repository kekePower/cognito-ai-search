- Created detailed removal plan with impact assessment
- Established verification procedures for each phase

**Phase 2: Bulk Component Removal**
- Systematic removal of clearly unused components
- Real-time build verification after each removal batch
- Dependency cleanup for removed components

**Phase 3: Tailwind CSS Cleanup**
