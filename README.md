## What Can Cognito AI Search Do For You?

Cognito AI Search is built on two core pillars, designed to work together seamlessly or independently:

### ü§ñ Your Personal AI Assistant, On Your Terms

Imagine having an AI assistant that operates entirely on your own computer. Cognito AI Search makes this possible by integrating with local AI models like LLaMA or Mistral (via Ollama). This means:

*   **True Privacy:** Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine. What you ask and the responses you receive remain confidential.
*   **Offline Access:** Because the AI runs locally, you can often get answers and assistance even without an active internet connection.
*   **Customization:** You have the freedom to choose the AI model that best suits your needs and configure how it responds.

### üåê Private and Unbiased Web Search

When you need to search the wider internet, Cognito AI Search uses a self-hosted instance of SearXNG. This is a powerful metasearch engine that fetches results from various sources without compromising your privacy. Key benefits include:

*   **Anonymous Searching:** Your search queries are not logged or tied to your identity. Each search is a fresh start.
*   **No Tracking or Profiling:** Unlike many commercial search engines, Cognito AI Search doesn't build a profile on you, ensuring the results you see are not influenced by past behavior or targeted advertising.
*   **Aggregated Results:** Get a broader perspective by seeing results from multiple search engines in one place.

## Key Advantages of Using Cognito AI Search

Choosing Cognito AI Search means prioritizing your digital autonomy. Here‚Äôs what sets it apart:

*   **Complete Data Control:** By self-hosting, you are in full command of your data. Nothing is sent to external servers without your explicit action.
*   **Freedom from Ads and Trackers:** Enjoy a cleaner, more focused experience without targeted advertisements or hidden data collection.
*   **Efficient and User-Friendly:** The interface is designed to be lightweight and responsive, delivering quick results on any device without unnecessary clutter.
*   **IPv6 Support:** Configurable for accessibility over IPv6. See [HOWTO.md#ipv6-support-configuration](docs/HOWTO.md#ipv6-support-configuration) for details.
